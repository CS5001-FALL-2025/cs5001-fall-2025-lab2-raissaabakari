# Variable Assignment
x = 5  # Assigning the value 5 to variable 'x'
name = "Alice"  # Assigning the string "Alice" to variable 'name'

print(x)       # Output: 5
print(name)    # Output: Alice


# Challenge: Create a variable with a value and print it.
last_name = 'Bakari'
print(last_name)



# Arithmetic Operations
a = 10
b = 3

sum_value = a + b         # Addition
difference = a - b        # Subtraction
product = a * b           # Multiplication
quotient = a / b          # Division
remainder = a % b         # Modulus (remainder of the division)

print("Sum:", sum_value)               # Output: 13
print("Difference:", difference)       # Output: 7
print("Product:", product)             # Output: 30
print("Quotient:", quotient)           # Output: 3.333...
print("Remainder:", remainder)         # Output: 1

# Challenge: Perform arithmetic operations on two numbers and print the results.
x = 5
y = 3

add = x + y 
subtract = x - y
multiply = x * y 
divide = x / y 
remainder = x % y

print('x + y = ', add)
print('x - y = ', subtract)
print('x * y = ', multiply)
print('x / y = ', divide)
print('x % y = ', remainder)



# String Concatenation
greeting = "Hello"
name = "Alice"

full_greeting = greeting + ", " + name + "!"
print(full_greeting)   # Output: Hello, Alice!


# Challenge: Concatenate three strings and print the result.

word1 = 'My'
word2 = 'name is'
word3 = 'Raissa!'

print(word1 + ' ' + word2 + ' ' + word3)


# Combining variables and expressions
num1 = 8
num2 = 2
result = num1 + num2

message = "The sum of " + str(num1) + " and " + str(num2) + " is " + str(result)
print(message)  # Output: The sum of 8 and 2 is 10

# Challenge: Add two numbers and print the result using string concatenation.
x = 10
y = 7
answer = x + y 

print('The sum of ' + str(x) + ' and ' + str(y) + ' is ' + str(answer))



'''
Summary of Key Concepts:
Variables store information and are created using =.

Arithmetic expressions include operations like addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).

String concatenation combines strings using the + operator.

Use str() to convert numbers into strings for concatenation.

Feel free to practice these mini challenges to reinforce your understanding!

# Variable Naming Conventions

# 2student = "Bob"     # Can't start with number
# student-name = "Bob" # No hyphens allowed
# class = "CS5001"     # 'class' is a reserved word
